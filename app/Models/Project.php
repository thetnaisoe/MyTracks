    //In Laravel, the $fillable property of a model class is an array that contains the names of the database columns that can be mass assigned.Mass assignment is a feature of Laravel's Eloquent ORM that allows you to create a new model instance and set its attributes at the same time.the $fillable property is set to ['name', 'description', 'image_url']. This means that only these columns can be mass assigned. Any other columns in the projects table are protected against mass assignment.
